    <h2>Information and consent</h2>
    <h1>Online studies in perception, learning and decision-making</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to the experiment. Before taking part, it is important that we
      receive informed consent from each participant before they begin. Before
      signing this form, make sure that you carefully read the
      study details below.
    </p>

    <h3>What is the purpose of this study?</h3>
    <p>
      We are interested in how the adult brain controls learning and
      decision-making. This research aims to provide insights into how the
      healthy brain works to help us understand the causes of a number of
      different medical conditions.
    </p>

    <h3>Who is conducting this research study?</h3>
    <p>
      This research is being conducted by the Wellcome Centre for Human
      Neuroimaging and the Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry
      and Ageing Research. The lead researcher for this project is Dr Jessica
      McFadyen (<a href="mailto:j.mcfadyen@ucl.ac.uk?Subject=[Online%20Study]" target="_top">j.mcfadyen@ucl.ac.uk</a>). This study has been approved by the UCL Research Ethics Committee
      (project ID number 9929/002) and funded by the Wellcome Trust.
    </p>

    <h3>Who can participate in the study?</h3>
    <p>
      We are recruiting participants aged between 18 and 40 years old who
      spoke English as a first language.
    </p>

    <h3>What will happen to me if I take part?</h3>
    <p>
      You will play an online computer game, which will last
      <strong>up to 90 minutes</strong>. We ask that you <span style="color:red">only participate in this experiment if you have time to complete the entire experiment</span>. You will receive £5 for participating but you can receive a <strong>BONUS
        £5</strong> by finishing the game and performing well.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will also be asked some questions about yourself, your feelings,
      background, attitudes, and behaviour in your everyday life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember, you are free to withdraw at any time (and you don't need to
      provide a reason).
    </p>

    <h3>What are the possible disadvantages and risks of taking part?</h3>
    <p>
      You will be asked to answer some questions about mood and feelings, and
      we can provide information about ways to seek help should you feel
      affected by the issues raised by these questions.
    </p>

    <h3>What are the possible benefits of taking part?</h3>
    <p>
      While there are no immediate benefits to taking part, your participation
      in this research will help us understand how people make decisions and
      this could have benefits for our understanding of mental health
      problems.
    </p>

    <h3>Complaints</h3>
    <p>
      If you wish to complain or have any concerns about any aspect of the way
      you have been approached or treated by members of staff, then the
      research UCL complaints mechanisms are available to you. In the first
      instance, please talk to the researcher or the chief investigator
      (Professor Ray Dolan,
      <a href="mailto:r.dolan@ucl.ac.uk?Subject=[Study%20Complaint]" target="_top">r.dolan@ucl.ac.uk</a>) about your complaint. If you feel that the complaint has not been
      resolved satisfactorily, please contact the chair of the UCL Research
      Ethics Committee (<a href="mailto:ethics@ucl.ac.uk?Subject=[Study%20Complaint]" target="_top">ethics@ucl.ac.uk</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are concerned about how your personal data are being processed
      please contact the data controller who is UCL:
      <a href="mailto:protection@ucl.ac.uk?Subject=[Study%20Complaint]" target="_top">protection@ucl.ac.uk</a>. If you remain unsatisfied, you may wish to contact the Information
      Commissioner’s Office (ICO). Contact details, and details of data
      subject rights, are available on the
      <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/data-protection-reform/overview-of-the-gdpr/individuals-rights" target="_top">ICO website</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>What about my data?</h3>
    <p>
      To help future research and make the best use of the research data you
      have given us (such as answers to questionnaires) we may keep your
      research data indefinitely and share these. The data we collect will be
      shared and held as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In publications, your data will be anonymised, so you cannot be
        identified.
      </li>
      <li>
        In public databases, your data will be anonymised or pseudonymised
        (your personal details will be removed and a code used (e.g. 123456)
        instead of your user ID)
      </li>
      <li>
        Personal data is any information that could be used to identify you,
        such as your user ID. This will be held securely at UCL and will never
        be shared. If you participate in other research studies from our
        research group, your user ID may be used to link your data between the
        two research studies. Your personal data will be deleted or destroyed
        as soon as it is deemed redundant.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The legal basis used to process your personal data will be the provision
      of public task (this means that the research you are taking part in is
      deemed to be in the public interest). We will follow the UCL and legal
      guidelines to safeguard your data.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you change your mind and withdraw your consent to participate in this
      study you can
      <a href="mailto:j.mcfadyen@ucl.ac.uk?Subject=[Withdraw%20Consent]" target="_top">contact the lead researcher via email</a>. If you wish, we will delete your data.
      <strong>However, anonymised or pseudonymised data and research results
        already shared with other investigators or the general public cannot
        be destroyed, withdrawn or recalled.</strong>
    </p>
